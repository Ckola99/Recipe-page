## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned and refined my understanding of css selectors and I learned more about padding, margin as well as containers.

``` .ingredients li {
	padding-left: 14px;
	margin: 5px 0;
}

.ingredients li::marker {
	color: var(--heading-color);
	font-weight: 100;
} 

I learned about a new pseudo selector "::marker" through the MDN docs.
